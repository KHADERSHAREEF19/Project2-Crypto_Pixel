Pixel manipulation for image encryption involves altering the pixel values of an image to encode hidden information or to make the image unreadable without decryption. Here’s a brief overview of how pixel manipulation can be used for image encryption:

Pixel Value Modification: The simplest method involves directly modifying the pixel values using mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. For instance, adding a secret key value to each pixel can alter its intensity.

Pixel Rearrangement: Another approach is to rearrange the pixels based on a predefined pattern or algorithm. This scrambling can be done using techniques like permutation matrices or cryptographic algorithms.

Bit-level Manipulation: Manipulating the individual bits of pixel values is a more intricate method. This can involve techniques like bit substitution, where specific bits are replaced with bits from a secret key or algorithmically generated sequence.

Transformations: Applying mathematical transformations like Fourier transforms or wavelet transforms to pixel data can obscure the image in a way that requires a specific decryption key or algorithm to revert to the original form.

Key-based Encryption: Using a secret key to control the transformation or manipulation process ensures that only those with the correct key can decrypt the image back to its original form.

Steganography: While not strictly pixel manipulation, steganography embeds hidden information within the image itself, often in less significant bits or in the frequency domain, which requires specific knowledge or a key to extract.
